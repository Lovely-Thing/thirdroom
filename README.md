## Local Development

After you've installed node.js locally, run the following commands.

```
npm install -g yarn
yarn
yarn bootstrap
yarn start
```

Open http://localhost:3000

Thirdroom comes configured out of the box to communicate with the thirdroom.io homeserver so you don't need to set anything else up when developing against it.
